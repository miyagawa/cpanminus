NAME
    App::cpanminus - get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN

SYNOPSIS
        cpanm Module

    Run `cpanm -h' or `perldoc cpanm' for more options.

DESCRIPTION
    cpanminus is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from
    CPAN and does nothing else.

    It's dependency free (can bootstrap itself), requires zero
    configuration, and stands alone. When running, it requires only 10MB of
    RAM.

INSTALLATION
    There are several ways to install cpanminus to your system.

  Package management system
    There are Debian packages, RPMs, FreeBSD ports, and packages for other
    operation systems available. If you want to use the package management
    system, search for cpanminus and use the appropriate command to install.
    This makes it easy to install `cpanm' to your system without thinking
    about where to install, and later upgrade.

  Installing to system perl
    You can also use the latest cpanminus to install cpanminus itself:

        curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus

    This will install `cpanm' to your bin directory like `/usr/local/bin'
    (unless you configured `INSTALL_BASE' with local::lib), so you probably
    need the `--sudo' option.

  Installing to local perl (perlbrew)
    If you have perl in your home directory, which is the case if you use
    tools like perlbrew, you don't need the `--sudo' option, since you're
    most likely to have a write permission to the perl's library path. You
    can just do:

        curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus

    to install the `cpanm' executable to the perl's bin path, like
    `~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm'.

  Downloading the standalone executable
    You can also copy the standalone executable to whatever location you'd
    like.

        cd ~/bin
        curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm
        chmod +x cpanm
        # edit shebang if you don't have /usr/bin/env

    This just works, but be sure to grab the new version manually when you
    upgrade because `--self-upgrade' might not work for this.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.8 or later.

    *   'tar' executable (bsdtar or GNU tar version 1.22 are rcommended) or
        Archive::Tar to unpack files.

    *   C compiler, if you want to build XS modules.

    *   make

    *   Module::Build (core in 5.10)

QUESTIONS
  Another CPAN installer?
    OK, the first motivation was this: the CPAN shell runs out of memory (or
    swaps heavily and gets really slow) on Slicehost/linode's most
    affordable plan with only 256MB RAM. Should I pay more to install perl
    modules from CPAN? I don't think so.

  But why a new client?
    First of all, let me be clear that CPAN and CPANPLUS are great tools
    I've used for *literally* years (you know how many modules I have on
    CPAN, right?). I really respect their efforts of maintaining the most
    important tools in the CPAN toolchain ecosystem.

    However, for less experienced users (mostly from outside the Perl
    community), or even really experienced Perl developers who know how to
    shoot themselves in their feet, setting up the CPAN toolchain often
    feels like yak shaving, especially when all they want to do is just
    install some modules and start writing code.

  Zero-conf? How does this module get/parse/update the CPAN index?
    It queries the CPAN Meta DB site at http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/.
    The site is updated at least every hour to reflect the latest changes
    from fast syncing mirrors. The script then also falls back to scrape the
    site http://search.cpan.org/.

    Fetched files are unpacked in `~/.cpanm' and automatically cleaned up
    periodically. You can configure the location of this with the
    `PERL_CPANM_HOME' environment variable.

  Where does this install modules to? Do I need root access?
    It installs to wherever ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build are
    configured to (via `PERL_MM_OPT' and `PERL_MB_OPT'). So if you're using
    local::lib, then it installs to your local perl5 directory. Otherwise it
    installs to the site_perl directory that belongs to your perl.

    cpanminus at a boot time checks whether you have configured local::lib,
    or have the permission to install modules to the site_perl directory. If
    neither, it automatically sets up local::lib compatible installation
    path in a `perl5' directory under your home directory. To avoid this,
    run the script as the root user, with `--sudo' option or with
    `--local-lib' option.

  cpanminus can't install the module XYZ. Is it a bug?
    It is more likely a problem with the distribution itself. cpanminus
    doesn't support or is known to have issues with distributions like as
    follows:

    *   Tests that require input from STDIN.

    *   Tests that might fail when `AUTOMATED_TESTING' is enabled.

    *   Modules that have invalid numeric values as VERSION (such as `1.1a')

    These failures can be reported back to the author of the module so that
    they can fix it accordingly, rather than me.

  Does cpanm support the feature XYZ of CPAN and CPANPLUS?
    Most likely not. Here are the things that cpanm doesn't do by itself.
    And it's a feature - you got that from the name *minus*, right?

    If you need these features, use CPAN, CPANPLUS or the standalone tools
    that are mentioned.

    *   Bundle:: module dependencies

    *   CPAN testers reporting

    *   Building RPM packages from CPAN modules

    *   Listing the outdated modules that needs upgrading. See
        App::cpanoutdated

    *   Uninstalling modules. See pm-uninstall.

    *   Showing the changes of the modules you're about to upgrade. See
        cpan-listchanges

    *   Patching CPAN modules with distroprefs.

    See cpanm or `cpanm -h' to see what cpanminus *can* do :)
