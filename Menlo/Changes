   [Improvements]
      - Add a workaround for distributions with an old (buggy) Module::Install, now that the problems

      - Remove MakeMaker and Module::Build from cpanm's runtime dependencies. Rather it will upgrade
        the minimum version requirement as it finds distributions that uses them in configure
        requirements. Also, they will be installed with 'notest' option for now, since Module::Build
        test suite takes a bit too long time.

1.7032  2015-04-29 18:51:36 PDT
   [Improvements]
      - Prefer to use cpanmetadb's package history API for pinning versions. Note that it only
        works against versions since April 2012. You can set `--metacpan` to still prefer MetaCPAN
        API search, and can use `--cascade-search` to fallback to MetaCPAN after CPAN MetaDB as well.

1.6931  2013-07-24 14:50:59 PDT
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Use (patched) Parse::PMFile to parse packages and versions from current directory
        rather than Module::Metadata from blib.
      - Fixes a bug where install.json has bogus file path in provides
      - Honor no_index metadata when scanning provides from .pm files
      - no_index fatscript.pm since fatpacks bunch of external modules

1.6930  2013-07-24 13:46:10 PDT
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Fixed fatscript.pm being stripped, causing issues with Metadata inspection
      - Bumped Module::CPANfile

1.6929  2013-07-24 11:45:48 PDT
   [New Features]
      - Include App/cpanminus/fatscript.pm which is exactly the same content as cpanm.
        This allows both calling .pm as a script or reading the content to call with Scriptlet,
        which would also make fatpacking cpanm (in another program!) easier.
      - Removed the Share dir feature added in 1.6928 in favor of fatscript

1.6928  2013-07-23 14:10:20 PDT

        with Crixa-0.01 (https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/issues/274)

   [Improvements]
      - Document --with-develop

        dependencies in Module::Install-based distributions

1.6922  2013-06-19 13:55:54 PDT
   [Improvements]
      - No changes in the code, packaging update so the fatpacked executable on cpanm has
        the right version. #274

1.6921  2013-06-18 03:18:55 PDT
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Fixes install with Module::Build < 0.35, i.e. vanilla perl 5.10.1
        (Thanks to joshk for the report)
      - Fixes install on 5.8 with Module::Build dists without configure_requires #273
        (Thanks to gildegoma for the report)

1.6920  2013-06-14 14:08:44 PDT
   [Improvements]
      - Handle PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT in case multiple paths are stacked (mst)
      - Remove the search.cpan.org fallback where no META files exist. Generate stub using CPAN::Meta

1.6919  2013-06-12 08:32:06 PDT
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Automatically detect local::lib mode when environment variables are already configured
        on the shell. This is to fix the first time run when local::lib is configure but arch
        library path doesn't exist. #263

      - build.log is now created inside a work directory, then a symlink to the file is
        made in ~/.cpanm. On platforms where symlink is not available (Win32), the build.log
        file is copied from the build directory once the installation has finished. (ilmari)

      - When you have a 1.01 of module X and CPAN mirror has 1.00, `cpanm X` would not
        overwrite with 1.00, unless you specify `--reinstall`. `cpanm X@1.00` will
        continue installing the version (and ranges) you specify. #257

      - Add back Module::CPANfile to fatpack, accidentally deleted in a previous release
      - Remove CPAN::Meta from fatpack, because it's unsued yet. This reduces the file
        size of cpanm executable about 30%.

   [Improvements]
      - Re-enable --metacpan option to prefer MetaCPAN over CPANMetaDB for all queries,
        mostly for testing purpose.
      - Improved MetaCPAN queries in case a release have multiple modules with different
        versions. Also fixed a bug where it tried to extract distribution version as a
        module version in some cases

1.59_08 Wed Feb  6 11:25:45 PST 2013
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Prioritize MetaCPAN when --dev option is enabled, for real

        search that doesn't match package name on PAUSE but returns a hit on search.cpan.org
        can't be installed anymore. You have to use the right package name for it.
      - Enable MetaCPAN search by default. --metacpan option is deprecated

   [New Features]
      - EXPERIMENTAL: --dev option to enable including developer release for searching
        against MetaCPAN

   [New Features]
      - Support version ranges in command args and cpanfile queried agsinst MetaCPAN
        with the proper version range query to get the best version that satisfies
        the requirements. Huge thanks to #metacpan guys

1.59_04 Sun Feb  3 09:04:12 PST 2013
   [Improvements]

      - Support version range with "~", such as cpanm DBI~">= 1.0, < 2.0"
      - Enable metacpan release search when exact version is given (and when mirror-only is not specified)
        i.e. cpanm DBI@1.100 will fetch the exact release based on metacpan

1.59_01 Thu Jan 31 09:54:50 PST 2013
   [New Features]
      - Added a proper support for version range in MYMETA files using CPAN::Meta::Requirements
      - Skip installing modules when found versions from CPAN doesn't satisfy the requirement, rather
        than proceeding as if it is ok. For instance, if a ditribution X requires Y >= 1.1 and Y on
        CPAN (or your CPAN mirror) has 1.0, cpanm will just complain and stop installing it.
      - Better cpanfile end-to-end support
      - Upgraded fatpacked modules to the latest

1.5021 Thu Jan 31 00:42:28 PST 2013

   [Improvements]
      - Upgraded many fatlib embedded modules
      - Support --no-quiet
      - Removed ugly @INC dumping hack for -L. This causes modules that has conditional
        deps such as Any::Moose not to pull down necessary requirements. This is a known
        issue and will be addressed later.
      - Support special _ for -l and -L argument to respect local::lib defaults #115


1.49_02 Wed Oct 12 18:53:35 JST 2011

      - Delay load Module::Build bootstrap so that -L won't auto-intall the latest M::B

1.4007 Tue May 17 10:51:18 PDT 2011
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Remove LWP from Makefile.PL dependencies, since due to the split it brings in many
        dependencies such as HTTP::Daemon and HTTP::Parser (which requires a C compiler).
        HTTP::Tiny is embedded as a last resort anyway, and if Makefile.PL is executed via
        some CPAN client (CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS or cpanminus) it means your client is already
        configured to be able to fetch files over HTTP.

1.4006 Mon May 16 10:02:45 PDT 2011
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Proper fix for the -l option installing the same modules

      - -l should now correctly locate installed modules to skip reinstalling. Regression in 1.4004
      - Ignore Module::CoreList loading errors with -L on perl < 5.8.9
      - Fixed --prompt in combination with --quiet RT:66602
      - Fixed a broken Bundle:: module installation

1.4004 Thu Mar 10 10:04:28 PST 2011
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Fixed the issue where `ssh host cpanm Module` waits on input forever. As a side
        effect of fixing this bug, cpanm reads modules from STDIN only if there's no
        module arguments given. Options such as -L or --scandeps continu to work. #86
        (Reported by dku, Getty and many people)

   [Bug Fixes]
      - Fixed a long standing bug where newer versions of bundled modules such as LWP
        could be loaded when combined with -L or -l, which causes API incompatiblities.
      - Fixed the use of gunzip (cho45)

1.4003  Wed Mar  9 18:13:21 PST 2011
      - Fixed a weird bug that -L fails to bootstrap Module::Build when an old version
        such as 0.28 is installed 
      - Do not show help if it reads args from STDIN and nothing is supplied
      - Stripped down the `cpanm` executable size for 20% by stripping POD for fatpacked
        dependencies :)

1.4002  Tue Mar  8 17:47:51 PST 2011
      - Display configure errors in --scandeps so that configure_requires can be
        manually satisfied (suggested by marcus)

1.4001  Tue Mar  8 10:10:28 PST 2011
      - Fixed a workaround code for META.yml being JSON (reported by leedo)

1.4000  Tue Mar  8 01:00:49 PST 2011
   [New Features]
      - Changed the verbosity level of -q to be actually *so* useful and recommended now
      - Added a new option --no-man-pages to skip man page generation and installation
      - Added new --scandeps and --format option that scans module dependency tree before
        actually installing a module
      - Support Bundle:: modules
      - Added new --save-dists option

   See below changes between 1.30_02 and 1.30_13 for more improvements and bug fixes.

1.30_13  Mon Mar  7 10:42:01 PST 2011
   - Fix for the use of Module::CoreList for perl with versions ending in 0, such as 5.13.10.
   - Do not attempt to upgrade Module::Build if you have the version that comes with perl

1.30_12  Sun Mar  6 18:54:41 PST 2011
   - Support Bundle:: modules #81
   - Fixed a bug where META.yml is being fetched for no reason. This reduces the HTTP
     GET calls a lot and should speed up the build process
   - Falls back to search.cpan.org/meta service when (and only when) META.yml is not
     included or unparsable. Now it can handle distributions like AnyEvent::HTTP or
     ancient packages better.
   - Fixed a bug where nmake is doubly quoted on Win32 (charsbar) #76
   - Makes the wget/curl execution safer (J. Nick Koston)
   - Support archives where tar list begins with ./ like Image::Magick (Reported by doy) #80

1.30_11  Sun Mar  6 01:34:59 PST 2011
   - Fix SIGNATURE testing for Module::Build 0.38 or later
   - Implemented EXPERIMENTAL --scandeps command and --format option
   - Implemented EXPERIMENTAL --save-tarballs option
   - Show (undef) in the version output instead of ()

1.30_10  Sat Mar  5 14:55:16 PST 2011
   - Changed how it special cases Module::Build load path in -L mode. It's much more
     reliable and support 0.38 with the new CPAN::Meta dependencies

1.30_09  Fri Mar  4 18:15:40 PST 2011
   - Changed the verbosity level of -q|--quiet so that it prints only necessary
     information (instead of nothing, which is not really useful)
   - Shows the number of distribution in the end of the session

1.30_08  Fri Mar  4 16:04:29 PST 2011
   - Renamed the option to --man-pages and --no-man-pages

1.30_07  Fri Mar  4 15:19:44 PST 2011
   - Disable the man page generation by default only if -L is in use. (suggested by rjbs)

1.30_06  Fri Mar  4 14:55:35 PST 2011
   - Skip the man page generation by default. You can enable it with --pod2man

1.30_05  Fri Mar  4 01:36:28 PST 2011
   - Fixed the way it reduces @INC in the tests when -L is in use, so the tests
     that call $^X with -I can keep those library paths. i.e. Test::More

1.30_04  Fri Mar  4 00:46:24 PST 2011
   - Support minor case where blib/* is manually added via -I (e.g. FCGI.pm)

1.30_03  Fri Mar  4 00:30:39 PST 2011
   - Fixed a bug the modules are not loaded from blib in test_harness with -L

1.30_02  Thu Mar  3 19:53:30 PST 2011
   - Fixed a bug where tests are loading modules from your site_perl even when -L is used

1.3001   Thu Mar  3 18:33:56 PST 2011
   - Documentation overhaul
   - Fixed a bug -L will install non-core modules again and again for each run

1.3000   Wed Mar  2 14:39:44 PST 2011
   - No changes since the last beta

1.29_02  Tue Mar  1 16:06:20 PST 2011
   - Improved the dependencies detection when -L is in use so the core modules that have been upgraded
     inside can be correctly be detected, using Module::CoreList.
   - Added a crazy hack to support Build.PL configure dependencies > 0.36 when -L is in effect

1.29_01  Mon Feb 28 18:57:27 PST 2011
   - Disable --uninstall-shadows by default for perl >= 5.12

1.19_02 Tue Jan 18 14:11:23 PST 2011
   - Module::Metadata now requires version.pm 0.87. This makes cpanm unable to boostrap when version.pm is
     older than that. For now, include the pure perl version/vpp.pm and version.pm in the fatlib and then
     fatpacked in cpanm executable #78

1.19_01 Tue Jan 18 12:48:47 PST 2011

1.1005  Tue Dec 14 15:07:31 PST 2010
   - Accept Foo/Bar/Baz.pm style invocation in args (requested by larryl and many others)

1.1004  Tue Nov 30 10:03:01 PST 2010
   - Fixed a bug where uncompressed and compressed index timestamps are out of sync which causes
     issues when the local and mirror server's clocks are out of sync (reported by sukria)

1.1003  Thu Nov 25 01:17:28 PST 2010

     versions of wget/curl (rsp)

1.0012  Fri Aug 20 12:46:34 PDT 2010
   - version check with -L and -l was failing with --skip-installed default. Now fixed (reported by leedo) #55
   - Fixed the code to find root of tarballs (perlpilot)

1.0011  Wed Aug 18 16:38:24 PDT 2010
