0.99_26 Mon Mar 22 20:22:10 PDT 2010
   [Developer Fixes]
      - Fixed the broken delay loaded LWP runtime in -L
      - Actually changed how -L sets up @INC so that it won't affect the current
        cpanm process at all which is more correct way to deal with this.

0.99_25 Mon Mar 22 19:52:12 PDT 2010
   [Improvements]
      - Log version information of build tools in build.log
   
   [Developer Fixes]
      - Fixed the way it passes DumpedINC
      - Fixes tools initialization like LWP with -L
      - Set PID in PERL5_CPAN*_IS_RUNNING rather than just 1

        and its non-core dependencies into local::lib directory

   [Developer Fixes]
      - Use Module::Metadata and avoid calling another perl interpreter
        to check the installed versions of the modules
      - Also dump @INC into a file DumpedINC.pm when self-contained is enabled
      - Set PERL5_CPANM_IS_RUNNING in configure
