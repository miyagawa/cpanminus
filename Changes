      - MetaCPAN and BackPAN search using MetaCPAN API
      - --dev to install developer releases
      - Install via git:// URL (with @branch, tag or commit)
      - Better MYMETA version range and cpanfile support
      - No fallback to search.cpan.org, which means you can't install from command names

1.59_13 Mon Feb 25 12:06:44 PST 2013
   [New Features]
      - Support @branch (or commit or tag) in Git URLs so that you can specify a
        commitish to check out before installing from Git repo
      - Search for BackPAN by default when specific version (or range) is requested

   [Improvements]
      - Detect .zip root directory more reliably (frioux)

   [New Features]
      - EXPERIMENTAL: added an ability to install from git URL (ikasam_a)

   [Improvements]
      - Exclude backpan distribution from MetaCPAN query (mo)
      - Add back Module::CPANfile to fatpack, accidentally deleted in a previous release
      - Remove CPAN::Meta from fatpack, because it's unsued yet. This reduces the file
        size of cpanm executable about 30%.

1.59_09 Thu Feb  7 01:55:48 PST 2013
   [Improvements]
      - Re-enable --metacpan option to prefer MetaCPAN over CPANMetaDB for all queries,
        mostly for testing purpose.
      - Improved MetaCPAN queries in case a release have multiple modules with different
        versions. Also fixed a bug where it tried to extract distribution version as a
        module version in some cases

1.59_08 Wed Feb  6 11:25:45 PST 2013
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Prioritize MetaCPAN when --dev option is enabled, for real

1.59_07 Wed Feb  6 11:08:05 PST 2013
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Disable implicit --skip-satisfied auto conversion with version specification
      - Do not fallback to search.cpan.org scraping anymore. This means some of the bogus
        search that doesn't match package name on PAUSE but returns a hit on search.cpan.org
        can't be installed anymore. You have to use the right package name for it.
      - Enable MetaCPAN search by default. --metacpan option is deprecated

   [New Features]
      - EXPERIMENTAL: --dev option to enable including developer release for searching
        against MetaCPAN

   [Improvements]
      - Improve MetaCPAN query to search stable releases, unless developer release is requested

   [Incompatible Changes]
      - --mirror-index option doesn't automatically assume --mirror-only

   [Improvements]
      - Use versioned MetaCPAN API endpoint (oalders)

1.59_05 Mon Feb  4 11:49:40 PST 2013
   [New Features]
      - Support version ranges in command args and cpanfile queried agsinst MetaCPAN
        with the proper version range query to get the best version that satisfies
        the requirements. Huge thanks to #metacpan guys

1.59_04 Sun Feb  3 09:04:12 PST 2013
   [Improvements]
      - Make file copy more reliable on Win32 (A.J. Lucas) #180
      - Always send cpanminus User-Agent to the servers no matter which backend is used (curl, wget etc.)

1.59_02 Thu Jan 31 19:09:43 PST 2013
   [New Features]
      - Added experimental @ shortcut to mean exact version e.g. cpanm DBI@1.20
      - Support version range with "~", such as cpanm DBI~">= 1.0, < 2.0"
      - Enable metacpan release search when exact version is given (and when mirror-only is not specified)
        i.e. cpanm DBI@1.100 will fetch the exact release based on metacpan

1.59_01 Thu Jan 31 09:54:50 PST 2013
   [New Features]
      - Added a proper support for version range in MYMETA files using CPAN::Meta::Requirements
      - Skip installing modules when found versions from CPAN doesn't satisfy the requirement, rather
        than proceeding as if it is ok. For instance, if a ditribution X requires Y >= 1.1 and Y on
        CPAN (or your CPAN mirror) has 1.0, cpanm will just complain and stop installing it.
      - Better cpanfile end-to-end support
      - Upgraded fatpacked modules to the latest

1.5021 Thu Jan 31 00:42:28 PST 2013
   [Improvements]

   [Improvements]
      - Check cpanm path upon --self-upgrade to give warnings for perlbrew users

1.5017 Wed Jul 18 08:28:49 PDT 2012
   [Improvements]
      - Ignore tarballs whose first entry is "./" (doy) #184

1.5016 Tue Jul 17 12:00:57 PDT 2012
   [Improvements]
      - Added Module/CPANfile.pm to the fatlib. This allows bootstrapping dependencies
        with cpanm --installdeps on Heroku etc.

1.5015 Sun Jun 24 15:34:57 PDT 2012
   [Improvements]
      - Improved Makefile.PL to include bugtracker info (Ben Bullock)

   [Bug Fixes]
      - Use ExtUtils::Install to install meta files and let --sudo run it with sudo #124

1.5002 Tue Oct 18 09:06:17 JST 2011
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Make sure to include non-core perl modules in -L that are installed in 'perl' by mistake
      - Ensure all module names use :: instead of dashes because of EUMM NAME errors (Christian Walde)

1.5001 Fri Oct 14 00:18:33 JST 2011
   [New Features]
      - Added EXPERIMENTAL --metacpan support (tokuhirom)

   [Improvements]
      - Do not scan Makefile if MYMETA.yml is found

      - Fix CoreList bootstrap issue with perl < 5.8.9 when using -L
      - Dump more descriptive error message when configure failed with --installdeps #111

   [Improvements]
      - Upgraded many fatlib embedded modules
      - Support --no-quiet
      - Removed ugly @INC dumping hack for -L. This causes modules that has conditional
        deps such as Any::Moose not to pull down necessary requirements. This is a known
        issue and will be addressed later.
      - Support special _ for -l and -L argument to respect local::lib defaults #115


1.49_02 Wed Oct 12 18:53:35 JST 2011
   [Improvements]
      - Use Cwd::chdir to change PWD (yannk)

   [Bug Fixes]
      - Unbreak -L with newer ExtUtils::ParseXS installed

   [Developers]
      - Changed the path to save metadata information
      - removed Dist::Metadata use, but instead use Module::Metadata to get provides

      - Delay load Module::Build bootstrap so that -L won't auto-intall the latest M::B

1.4007 Tue May 17 10:51:18 PDT 2011
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Remove LWP from Makefile.PL dependencies, since due to the split it brings in many
        dependencies such as HTTP::Daemon and HTTP::Parser (which requires a C compiler).
        HTTP::Tiny is embedded as a last resort anyway, and if Makefile.PL is executed via
        some CPAN client (CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS or cpanminus) it means your client is already
        configured to be able to fetch files over HTTP.

1.4006 Mon May 16 10:02:45 PDT 2011
   [Bug Fixes]
      - Proper fix for the -l option installing the same modules

1.4005 Wed May 11 12:05:49 PDT 2011
   [Bug Fixes]
      - -l should now correctly locate installed modules to skip reinstalling. Regression in 1.4004
      - Ignore Module::CoreList loading errors with -L on perl < 5.8.9
      - Fixed --prompt in combination with --quiet RT:66602
      - Fixed a broken Bundle:: module installation

1.4004 Thu Mar 10 10:04:28 PST 2011
   [Incompatible Changes]
      - Fixed the issue where `ssh host cpanm Module` waits on input forever. As a side
        effect of fixing this bug, cpanm reads modules from STDIN only if there's no
        module arguments given. Options such as -L or --scandeps continu to work. #86
        (Reported by dku, Getty and many people)

   [Bug Fixes]
      - Fixed a long standing bug where newer versions of bundled modules such as LWP
        could be loaded when combined with -L or -l, which causes API incompatiblities.
      - Fixed the use of gunzip (cho45)

1.4003  Wed Mar  9 18:13:21 PST 2011
      - Fixed a weird bug that -L fails to bootstrap Module::Build when an old version
        such as 0.28 is installed 
      - Do not show help if it reads args from STDIN and nothing is supplied
      - Stripped down the `cpanm` executable size for 20% by stripping POD for fatpacked
        dependencies :)

1.4002  Tue Mar  8 17:47:51 PST 2011
      - Display configure errors in --scandeps so that configure_requires can be
        manually satisfied (suggested by marcus)

1.4001  Tue Mar  8 10:10:28 PST 2011
      - Fixed a workaround code for META.yml being JSON (reported by leedo)

1.4000  Tue Mar  8 01:00:49 PST 2011
   [New Features]
      - Changed the verbosity level of -q to be actually *so* useful and recommended now
      - Added a new option --no-man-pages to skip man page generation and installation
      - Added new --scandeps and --format option that scans module dependency tree before
        actually installing a module
      - Support Bundle:: modules
      - Added new --save-dists option

   See below changes between 1.30_02 and 1.30_13 for more improvements and bug fixes.

1.30_13  Mon Mar  7 10:42:01 PST 2011
   - Fix for the use of Module::CoreList for perl with versions ending in 0, such as 5.13.10.
   - Do not attempt to upgrade Module::Build if you have the version that comes with perl

1.30_12  Sun Mar  6 18:54:41 PST 2011
   - Support Bundle:: modules #81
   - Fixed a bug where META.yml is being fetched for no reason. This reduces the HTTP
     GET calls a lot and should speed up the build process
   - Falls back to search.cpan.org/meta service when (and only when) META.yml is not
     included or unparsable. Now it can handle distributions like AnyEvent::HTTP or
     ancient packages better.
   - Fixed a bug where nmake is doubly quoted on Win32 (charsbar) #76
   - Makes the wget/curl execution safer (J. Nick Koston)
   - Support archives where tar list begins with ./ like Image::Magick (Reported by doy) #80

1.30_11  Sun Mar  6 01:34:59 PST 2011
   - Fix SIGNATURE testing for Module::Build 0.38 or later
   - Implemented EXPERIMENTAL --scandeps command and --format option
   - Implemented EXPERIMENTAL --save-tarballs option
   - Show (undef) in the version output instead of ()

1.30_10  Sat Mar  5 14:55:16 PST 2011
   - Changed how it special cases Module::Build load path in -L mode. It's much more
     reliable and support 0.38 with the new CPAN::Meta dependencies

1.30_09  Fri Mar  4 18:15:40 PST 2011
   - Changed the verbosity level of -q|--quiet so that it prints only necessary
     information (instead of nothing, which is not really useful)
   - Shows the number of distribution in the end of the session

1.30_08  Fri Mar  4 16:04:29 PST 2011
   - Renamed the option to --man-pages and --no-man-pages

1.30_07  Fri Mar  4 15:19:44 PST 2011
   - Disable the man page generation by default only if -L is in use. (suggested by rjbs)

1.30_06  Fri Mar  4 14:55:35 PST 2011
   - Skip the man page generation by default. You can enable it with --pod2man

1.30_05  Fri Mar  4 01:36:28 PST 2011
   - Fixed the way it reduces @INC in the tests when -L is in use, so the tests
     that call $^X with -I can keep those library paths. i.e. Test::More

1.30_04  Fri Mar  4 00:46:24 PST 2011
   - Support minor case where blib/* is manually added via -I (e.g. FCGI.pm)

1.30_03  Fri Mar  4 00:30:39 PST 2011
   - Fixed a bug the modules are not loaded from blib in test_harness with -L

1.30_02  Thu Mar  3 19:53:30 PST 2011
   - Fixed a bug where tests are loading modules from your site_perl even when -L is used

1.3001   Thu Mar  3 18:33:56 PST 2011
   - Documentation overhaul
   - Fixed a bug -L will install non-core modules again and again for each run

1.3000   Wed Mar  2 14:39:44 PST 2011
   - No changes since the last beta

1.29_02  Tue Mar  1 16:06:20 PST 2011
   - Improved the dependencies detection when -L is in use so the core modules that have been upgraded
     inside can be correctly be detected, using Module::CoreList.
   - Added a crazy hack to support Build.PL configure dependencies > 0.36 when -L is in effect

1.29_01  Mon Feb 28 18:57:27 PST 2011
   - Disable --uninstall-shadows by default for perl >= 5.12

1.2001  Wed Feb 16 10:54:21 PST 2011
   - This be official 1.2
   - Skips tests during the bootstrap, making a much better first time experience

1.19_02 Tue Jan 18 14:11:23 PST 2011
   - Module::Metadata now requires version.pm 0.87. This makes cpanm unable to boostrap when version.pm is
     older than that. For now, include the pure perl version/vpp.pm and version.pm in the fatlib and then
     fatpacked in cpanm executable #78

1.19_01 Tue Jan 18 12:48:47 PST 2011
   - Upgraded bundled modules, notably Module::Metadata and local::lib
   - Switched the pure perl fallback to HTTP::Tiny

1.1007  Tue Jan 18 09:39:05 PST 2011
   - Fixed installation documents
   - Added PERL_CPANM_NO_AUTOMATED_TESTING to unset AUTOMATED_TESTING to find which modules break (mst)

1.1006  Thu Dec 16 11:27:29 PST 2010
   - Fixed docs to use curl instead of wget because of its cert bug
   - Fixed the usage of local() where PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNING was leaking (dg) #75

1.1005  Tue Dec 14 15:07:31 PST 2010
   - Accept Foo/Bar/Baz.pm style invocation in args (requested by larryl and many others)

1.1004  Tue Nov 30 10:03:01 PST 2010
   - Fixed a bug where uncompressed and compressed index timestamps are out of sync which causes
     issues when the local and mirror server's clocks are out of sync (reported by sukria)

1.1003  Thu Nov 25 01:17:28 PST 2010
   - Fixed a bug where --mirror-only doesn't detect module version updates (reported by sukria)

1.1002  Tue Nov 16 18:27:19 PST 2010
   - Implemented --auto-cleanup and set that to 7 (days) by default

1.1001  Fri Nov 12 12:37:31 PST 2010
   - Fixed the mirror index scanning code to uncompress on-disk and scan line-by-line
     to be less RAM hoggy (hobbs)
   - Fixed docs

1.1000  Thu Nov 11 23:56:46 PST 2010
   - Added --mirror-only to support minicpan and DarkPAN (jonallen, xdg, tokuhirom)

1.0015  Fri Sep 24 16:51:49 PDT 2010
